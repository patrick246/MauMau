Hello everyone reading this!
This is my first GitHub project, I decided to use it for a card game called MauMau.
The rules are simple:
 - You play with a double skat deck (64 cards) or a single
 - Everyone gets a specified amount of cards (can be 5 to 15)
 - One card is being opened from the remaining stack
 - Someone begins, usually this is the youngest player
 - You can play a card if this card matches the color or the number of the card. You can play for example Hearts King onto Hearts 10, or Spades 10 onto Hearts 10
 - If you only got one card, you have to say "mau" (not going to implement this)
 - You win if you got no more cards on your hand
 
Special cards:
	Jack
	You can decide which color needs to be played from now. Can be played at any time, the color doesn't matter.
	
	Seven
	The next in the round has to take 2 cards from the stack, only if he hasn't got another
	Seven, then the next one has to take 4 cards, if he also has got a Seven, the next poor guy has to take 6 cards,
	and so on, you get the point
	
	Eight
	The next player gets skipped.
	
	Nine
	You can play another card. If you can't play any other card, you have to take one from the stack.
